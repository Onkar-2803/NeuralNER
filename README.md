# NeuralNER
Implementation of Multilingual Neural NER mentioned in the paper "Judicious Selection of Training Data in Assisting Language for Multilingual Neural NER, Rudra Murthy and Anoop Kunchukuttan and Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, ACL 2018 , Melbourne, July 15-20, 2018"


Please read the Readme file of NeuralNERMono on how to train the network. The NeuralNERMono code is almost complete. However, the multilingual learning code works but needs some polishing.
